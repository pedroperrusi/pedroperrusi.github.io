I'm a medical robotics research engineer at the University of Strasbourg. My current responsibilities involve developing experiments for a novel  robotic needle steering strategy developed in [project Sperry](https://hadrien.courtecuisse.cnrs.fr/home/projects/sperry/). 
<!-- In this project, fast biomechanical simulations are used to account for the needle-tissue interaction during a robot-assisted needle therapy, such as thermo ablation or biopsies. -->

My research is in the crossroads of physics-based simulation and medical robotics supported by the the [ICube](https://icube.unistra.fr/) laboratory, [INRIA MIMESIS](https://mimesis.inria.fr/) team and the [University Hospital of Strasbourg](https://www.ihu-strasbourg.eu/).
