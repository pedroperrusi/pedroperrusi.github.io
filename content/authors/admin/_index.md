Passionate about technology and healthcare, I started my adventure in medical robotics in 2016 as undergraduate of mechatronics engineering in Brazil. In 2018, I had the opportunity to move to France to complete my studies in Biomedical Engineering with a master in robotics and automation. 

Now I look forward to new opportunities and to promote innovation to healthcare.
