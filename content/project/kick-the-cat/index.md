Kick the Cat is a Serious game to promote physical activities using the [6 minutes walk test](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK576420/).
A group of passionate volunteers met in Hacking Health Camp Strasbourg to work on the idea proposed by [Indoor Santé](http://indoor-sante.fr/).
During the the weekend, we matured the idea and built a working prototype using Unity 3D, augmented reality and GPS tracking.
