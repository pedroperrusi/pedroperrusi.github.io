CLARA is a robotic endoscope holder for laparoscopy developed at the automation and robotics lab [LARA](http://lara.unb.br/) at the University of Brasilia ([UnB](https://www.unb.br/)). The project was requested and founded by the [brazilian ministry of healthcare](https://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br) with the perspective to integrate the country unified healthcare system (SUS) in the future. 

Research and development counted with three professors and over 20 master and undergraduate students from 2015 until 2019.
My personal role was in the image acquisition and computer vision features of the system from 2015 until 2018.
In 2019, a startup spin-off was created to advance the technology to clinical trials and closer to the market.
